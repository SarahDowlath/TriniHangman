TriniHangman
============

Local Trinidad and Tobago version of Hangman which creates a fun game to test the user's knowledge of the culture of Trinidad and Tobago. 

The app allows the user to select a category from the list of Music, Sports, Festivities, Dialect (Slangs), FolkLore. 

The app selects a secret word or phrase at random from a list built into the program.

The app then prints out a row of dashes, one for each letter in the secret word, and asks the user to guess a letter. 
 
If the user guesses a letter that is part of the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. 

If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess and the stick man image of the hangman is shown for each letter that is not a part of the word. 

The user keeps guessing letters until either 
 
 (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or 
 (2) the user has made eight incorrect guesses.
